2.06 configs cannot be used with regular fuzion, and require some modification. The actual config processor is NOT changed to comply with licenses, but a custom CPP file to used to dynmically patch Fuzion's config loader. this is private software and does not have to be distributed.

this is called 'FuzionX' but will loosely work with fuzion if you know what you are doing.
